# Load-balancing
The codes of load balancing simulation and implementation.


1. File UnderQLoad contains the codes of designed algorithms. I realized them based on distributed system with SimPy package. 
SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on standard Python.

2. File ec2_LB contains the codes of algorithms in real AWS EC2 platform. I levarage Socket packages to operate interactions between all the instances in EC2.


The achievement is one accepted conference papaer and a submitted journal paper.
